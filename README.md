Conceptual relation markers in spanish specialized corpora

## Overview

This project explores the identification of conceptual relation markers (e.g., hypernymy, meronymy, causality) in Spanish specialized corpora. The goal is to detect these markers using machine learning models trained on annotated data.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains raw, processed, and annotated data.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `models/`: Trained models and their configurations.
- `src/`: Source code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `results/`: Evaluation reports and performance metrics.
- `tests/`: Unit tests for the codebase.

## Installation

Clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-research-project.git
